**Inputs to read:**
- `tests/` all test files
- `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/qa-engineer/test-plan.md` traceability matrix
- `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/qa-engineer/coverage/thresholds.json`
- `services/`, `libs/` source files (to identify untested paths)

**Review checklist:**
1. **Coverage gaps** — Identify source files with no corresponding test file. Identify public functions with no test. Identify error handling branches with no test.
2. **Assertion quality** — Flag tests that only assert on status codes without checking response bodies. Flag tests with no assertions (they always pass). Flag tests that assert on `true`/`false` instead of specific values.
3. **Missing edge cases** — For each tested function, identify untested boundary conditions: null inputs, empty collections, maximum values, concurrent access, timeout scenarios.
4. **Test independence** — Flag tests that depend on execution order. Flag tests that share mutable state through module-level variables. Flag tests that depend on the output of other tests.
5. **Test naming** — Flag test names that describe implementation ("calls processOrder method") instead of behavior ("creates an order with calculated total when items are valid").
6. **Mock quality** — Flag mocks that are too permissive (accept any input). Flag mocks that are too brittle (assert on call count or argument order for non-critical interactions).
7. **Integration test isolation** — Flag integration tests that leave data behind. Flag integration tests that fail when run in a different order.
8. **E2E test reliability** — Flag E2E tests with hardcoded waits. Flag E2E tests that depend on specific data IDs. Flag E2E tests that are not idempotent.
9. **Missing test types** — Cross-reference the test plan traceability matrix. Flag acceptance criteria with no corresponding test.
10. **Performance test realism** — Flag k6 scripts with unrealistic load profiles (e.g., 10,000 VUs for an internal tool). Flag scripts with missing thresholds.

**Output:** Write test quality findings to `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/code-reviewer/findings/` by severity. Write coverage gap analysis to `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/code-reviewer/metrics/coverage-gaps.json`.
